examples in the voltage module

several chanels: has voltage trace - several antena

sampled at 25htz - 2500 samples in 1 sec(voltage) 

visualization:

https://github.com/int-brain-lab/ibl-neuropixel - viewing the data.

To do:

Use python3.10 and get out of the conda nonsense (there is no need)


research:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs
- shannon information theory
-shannon sampling theorem
* need to understand -alaising


filter data using: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.sosfilt.html - use this for sampling


slice the data to only find one chanel
view the data in the chanel 
then push it through the mark Kramer github template.
then message him back

blue - visual 
green - hipocampus
pink - thalamus

choose a chanel in the green to work in
